Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:00:14 - deeznnutz: === Starting Meeting | 9 Sept 2024 @ 6PM EST===
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:00:18 - georgezgeorgez: Hello hello
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:00:21 - deeznnutz: hello!!
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:00:44 - deeznnutz: I'm trying the meeting start to make it easier to make the meeting minutes
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:01:53 - georgezgeorgez: It really needs a way to export by timeframe
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:02:04 - georgezgeorgez: But anyways
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:02:27 - deeznnutz: agree. I send a dm to coinselor . Should we start?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:02:36 - georgezgeorgez: Yes let's start
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:02:46 - georgezgeorgez: So I think we had a pretty productive last 2 weeks
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:02:54 - georgezgeorgez: Or at least, we have steady progress
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:03:03 - deeznnutz: ya, agree. I've got a little summary
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:03:06 - deeznnutz: Since our last meeting we've made good progress. I'll summarize the recent updates:

- Moved ARM support to a future release
- Added custom `znnd` Dashboard for integration with the Infinity Plugin. It's in the `/Dashboard` folder
- Added `--grafana` flag to install grafana, prometheus, node exporter and the standard node exporter dashboard
- Added noninteractive support for the `--deploy` flag
- Added DRAFT `README.md`
- Noninteractive support for `--grafana` is not working.

Did I miss anything?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:03:24 - georgezgeorgez: coinselor
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:03:34 - georgezgeorgez: his chatgpt made docs?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:03:42 - georgezgeorgez: if it's actually useful
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:03:54 - georgezgeorgez: not bad as a starting point at the very least
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:03:59 - deeznnutz: lol. ya, I asked it to make me a readme.md and it was pretty good. So I added it as a draft
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:04:52 - coinselor: I'm here ^^
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:05:02 - georgezgeorgez: I want to zoom out and go back to the three high level things

1. make it easy to deploy
2. help people monitor their system
3. help people support (diagnostics)
   Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:05:11 - georgezgeorgez: we're hitting a baseline maturity for 1 and 2
   Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:05:33 - georgezgeorgez: I want to start inviting people to beta test out the scripts/stack
   Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:05:51 - georgezgeorgez: and then next meeting, if we can have a polished version, that would be great
   Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:06:00 - georgezgeorgez: We should start thinking about 3
   Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:06:07 - deeznnutz: quickly.
   Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:06:09 - deeznnutz: Potential next steps before we request community testing:

- Setup go.zenon.sh for installation - Something like `curl -s https://go.zenon.sh/go-zenon.sh | bash`&#x20;

- Improve / finish the "docs" and/or `README.md`

- Fix the noninteractive support for `--grafana`&#x20;

Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:06:19 - deeznnutz: what do you think about these before asking for testing?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:07:16 - georgezgeorgez: I think the first bullet point isn't too critical for testing
curling a github raw asset is fine for now
For general release, yeah,
A good url would be nice
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:07:31 - georgezgeorgez: for 2, we need enough docs
but doesn't have to be perfect
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:07:39 - coinselor: help people support (diagnostics) -> this is kinda vague can you be more specific?

Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:08:12 - georgezgeorgez: Sure, so right now HC1, and in particular deeznnutz
does a lot of 1-1 sessions
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:08:26 - georgezgeorgez: with community members to help get their infra up and keep it running
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:08:54 - georgezgeorgez: and there's usually some back and forth in terms of asking questions
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:09:06 - georgezgeorgez: a lot of that can be streamlined
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:09:21 - georgezgeorgez: if for example, there was a tool that could fetch info about the node
and zip it up
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:09:49 - georgezgeorgez: so they can send it over to whoever is helping
or in a bug report
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:09:54 - georgezgeorgez: especially again, once we get into testnets
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:09:59 - georgezgeorgez: 0x linked a tool earlier
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:09:59 - georgezgeorgez: sos
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:10:36 - deeznnutz: each session has the same questions over and over and it takes like 15 minutes to get the info. Automating that would be so helpful
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:11:04 - deeznnutz: simple things like, is `go-zenon` running
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:11:06 - deeznnutz: lol
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:11:18 - deeznnutz: do you have enough hard drive space
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:11:24 - deeznnutz: is the swap file set
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:12:06 - deeznnutz: back to the public testing, getting the noninteractive install working is acutally important, b/ everyone asks what to do at those screens
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:12:18 - georgezgeorgez: i think we should do some more research into the tool and see if there are any alternatives
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:13:09 - georgezgeorgez: 0x do you have the link to that sos tool?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:13:26 - georgezgeorgez: i think it had a plugin architecture, and we could possibly write our own plugin
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:13:27 - deeznnutz: I have time this week to finish up the noninteractive fixes and finish the `readme.md` From there I think we can ask for testers. Agree?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:13:36 - coinselor: https://github.com/sosreport/sos
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:13:38 - coinselor: this?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:13:55 - deeznnutz: ya that one
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:14:15 - deeznnutz: it has a nice plugin system too. we can write one for znnd.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:14:25 - coinselor: "everyone asks what to do at those screens" - do you mean the znncontroller interactive screen?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:14:33 - deeznnutz: I would like to get the `config.json` without the producer password.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:14:38 - georgezgeorgez: I think non critical for the general release
but we've talked about it here
is historical timeseries for sync status
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:14:50 - georgezgeorgez: I think that will be our first entry into performance testing
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:15:00 - deeznnutz: <@coinselor:zenon.chat ""everyone asks what to do at tho..."> no, when you install an app in linux it asks if you want to restart a service.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:15:12 - georgezgeorgez: It would be good to compare the sync charts of nodes with and without vilkris's updates
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:15:13 - deeznnutz: that purple screen.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:15:45 - coinselor: lol ya, that purple screen i always press enter I don't even know what I'm looking at. Looks like some bios from 1980
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:16:14 - deeznnutz: exactly. I want to auto select enter for those.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:16:20 - coinselor: but can that be skipped? seems like some low level VM stuff
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:16:33 - deeznnutz: yes I can be auto selected
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:16:48 - deeznnutz: you tell it to accept all defaults and make the installation noninteractive.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:17:48 - georgezgeorgez: noninteractive will be more important for multinode setups
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:18:03 - georgezgeorgez: i'm guessing most people will still be ssh'ing to their box to install?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:18:16 - deeznnutz: ya I think so
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:18:36 - deeznnutz: I think we can target testing this week
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:19:06 - deeznnutz: improve readme.md and noninteractive and we can test I think
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:19:09 - georgezgeorgez: do we want to set a closer deadline to get some of these basics done?
then send out a call for beta testers?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:19:30 - deeznnutz: ya I'd like to start testing by Friday this week
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:21:04 - coinselor: My readme is chatgpt'd but I edited/proofread. I don't know what else could be added other than more content as we add more functionality
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:21:19 - coinselor: it's on my forked repo tho
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:21:31 - deeznnutz: maybe add a tl;dr getting started?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:21:36 - georgezgeorgez: make an mr
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:22:22 - coinselor: ok, I will maybe 0x can edit add stuff from his chatgpt readme XD
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:24:20 - deeznnutz: Regarding next steps and roadmap, I typed up a few things. Maybe we should prioritize?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:24:23 - deeznnutz: Roadmap

- ARM support

- Automate the installation and setup of the `znnd` Dashboard

- Troubleshooting script to send logs to devs

- Troubleshoot ports and accessibility (are my ports open)

- Deploy testnet

- Add `--uninstall` flag&#x20;

- Add `--backup` flag (I have a version of this script already)

Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:25:27 - deeznnutz: what is a higher priority? Automate the installation of the `znnd`dash or troubleshooting "stuff"
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:25:57 - georgezgeorgez: I think we should prioritize a single happy path that is useful to most people first
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:26:03 - coinselor: I can get a few aliens to commit to help us test it
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:26:25 - georgezgeorgez: What would enable people to actually start using the script and running their nodes with it?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:26:43 - georgezgeorgez: The priority should be first to get some real users
And then after that, they can help us prioritize
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:26:45 - deeznnutz: I like the `znnd` dash. It's actually pretty useful
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:27:14 - deeznnutz: so IMO the cool dash will be more useful to users than troubleshooting
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:27:48 - georgezgeorgez: yeah i think we can get 1 and 2 to a good spot before focusing on 3
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:27:52 - sugoi joined the room
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:27:56 - georgezgeorgez: usable spot
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:28:07 - sugoi: hi guys
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:28:15 - georgezgeorgez: hi welcome to the operations sig
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:29:25 - georgezgeorgez: not sure how much you have been following,
but we've been working on a znnd installation script and a dashboard to help people understand their node
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:29:51 - deeznnutz: does anyone have time to work on the auto deploy of the `znnd` dash? You can use some code already written in the script to deploy the dash w/ the api
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:29:57 - coinselor: <@georgezgeorgez:hc1.chat "What would enable people to actu..."> I would personally start using it because it just automates a lot of the stuff. Grafana dashboard and other stuff will also come handy if someone asks for system information.

Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:30:18 - sugoi: <@georgezgeorgez:hc1.chat "not sure how much you have been ..."> Trying to read up now. Thanks for the tl;dr!
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:30:39 - deeznnutz: so the dash requires:

- install the infinity plugin
- set the default datasource (127.0.0.1)
- import the dashboard w/ the api
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:30:49 - georgezgeorgez: Yes, we will likely be our own first users haha
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:31:40 - georgezgeorgez: <@deeznnutz:zenon.chat "so the dash requires:"> let's target this for friday?
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:31:41 - deeznnutz: it took me a while to figure out the import dash api. it had a bunch of size limits
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:32:19 - deeznnutz: <@georgezgeorgez:hc1.chat "let's target this for friday?"> I can get the readme and noninteractive done by this friday. Not sure about the `znnd` dash
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:32:28 - georgezgeorgez: I can work on it
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:32:46 - deeznnutz: OK if you have time, then I'm sure this friday is possible.
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:33:35 - deeznnutz: Just reuse this: https://github.com/go-zenon/go/blob/82ba64fbee715ad468c878a06cd16ac6258ccad1/grafana.sh#L119
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:34:01 - georgezgeorgez: yup
  0x, we can do it after this meeting and throughout the week
  but let's get more github issues created for all this
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:34:11 - deeznnutz: that node exporter dash was very large and I kept getting file size errors
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:34:15 - georgezgeorgez: I see you've created a couple already
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:34:24 - coinselor: yeah +1 to issues, break it down into tasks we can pick up
  Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:34:38 - coinselor: for instance I have no idea what this entails:

Troubleshooting script to send logs to devs
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:34:40 - deeznnutz: yep. Makes sense
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:35:25 - georgezgeorgez: Cool, so we have short term goals for this week
And also some other things on hold to revisit once we get it out for beta testing
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:35:32 - georgezgeorgez: Anything else we want to go over?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:35:37 - georgezgeorgez: Or just ideas?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:35:58 - deeznnutz: Awesome. I can also work on adding / cleaning up the issues this week.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:36:01 - deeznnutz: That all I had!
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:36:26 - georgezgeorgez: Let's get another meeting on the cal
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:36:32 - deeznnutz: I've gotten feedback from other devs watching this group and think we are making good progress on working together
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:36:50 - deeznnutz: So I'm happing we are making these small steps together
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:37:01 - coinselor: just wishful thinking but would be badass to add `--public`, `--sentry` ,`--pillar`
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:37:01 - georgezgeorgez: I think even though it's all over chat
Having regular times for the meetings helps moves things along
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:37:09 - deeznnutz: 23 Sept @ 6PM EST?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:37:21 - georgezgeorgez: Message deleted
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:37:33 - georgezgeorgez: <@coinselor:zenon.chat "just wishful thinking but would ..."> likely on our path
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:38:29 - georgezgeorgez: <@deeznnutz:zenon.chat "I've gotten feedback from other ..."> my goal with this sig so far has been to bootstrap some sort of steady collaborative effort
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:39:05 - coinselor: particularly for the upcoming sporks, I know there's a way to like upgrade the pillar with no downtime. I'm no doing that unless this script can handle it 😂 no worth the effort I rather miss the momentums lol
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:39:21 - georgezgeorgez: once we get some credibility
need to start figuring out incentives
then the pace can pick up
and really be driven by the community/userbase
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:39:32 - georgezgeorgez: <@coinselor:zenon.chat "particularly for the upcoming sp..."> bro make an issue
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:39:47 - georgezgeorgez: we need to track this stuff
even if it will be a bit before we get to it
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:40:02 - georgezgeorgez: it helps too, because other people might chime in and say it's important for them too
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:40:03 - deeznnutz: ya we have a feature request tag in there
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:40:12 - georgezgeorgez: And that will help us determine our priority
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:40:35 - deeznnutz: awesome. is everyone OK with 23 Sept @ 6PM EST?
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:40:39 - georgezgeorgez: but again
I'm pushing the saying
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:40:41 - georgezgeorgez: Incentivization is Prioritization
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:41:05 - georgezgeorgez: My idea is that SIGs define the frontier of development
What is the next possible thing we can do
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:41:15 - georgezgeorgez: And the community helps prioritize it by setting incentives
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:41:29 - deeznnutz: makes perfect sense!
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:41:51 - coinselor: ok next step is to populate github then
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:41:53 - coinselor: take it from there
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:42:13 - deeznnutz: Cool. thanks everyone. I'm around all week.
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:42:22 - georgezgeorgez: Thank you everyone, good meeting
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:42:29 - coinselor: gn!!
Mon, Sep 9, 2024, 23:42:33 - deeznnutz: gn
